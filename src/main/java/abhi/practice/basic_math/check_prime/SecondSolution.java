/**
 * Problem Statement: Given a number, check whether it is prime or not. A prime number is a natural number that is only divisible by 1 and by itself.
 * <p>
 * Examples 1 2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19 â€¦
 * <p>
 * Approach: Running the for loop till the square root of the number
 * Using a for loop for checking if the number is divisible by a number from 2 to its square root.
 * Running the for loop from 2 to the square root of the number.
 * And then checking if the number is divisible by the numbers from 2 to its square root.
 * Then, If the remainder is zero, that means it is divisible and hence not a prime number.
 * If the loop runs till square root and none of the numbers divided it completely. So it is the Prime number.
